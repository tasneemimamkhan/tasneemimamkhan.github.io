<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
<p>My name is Tasneem. I am the COO at Khan’s Tutorial, an online education company that aims to create upward mobility for families through virtual education, free community workshops, and scholarships for under-represented youth. Our programs at Khan’s Tutorial cater to each student’s personalized needs, with an emphasis on career and life goals in a culturally sensitive community setting. 

In 2004, I graduated from Barnard College with a degree in Computer Science and received my Masters in Public Health from Columbia University in 2012. I love reading fiction, drawing portraits, singing karaoke and giving back to the community.</p>
